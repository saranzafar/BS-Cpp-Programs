 --------- virtual Base class ---------

        --->> class B
class A              --->> class D
        --->> class C
        
if we make a variable 'a' in class A, when we inherit it from class B and class C now both classes
can use variable 'a' but when we apply multiple inherit from class D then variable 'a' occur two
times in class D in order to prevent this situation we use virtual Base class its syntax is
"class B : virtual class A"
Class A is vartual base class
