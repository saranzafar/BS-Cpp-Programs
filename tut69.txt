---------- Introduction to STL ----------
-->> STL standered templet library. it is library of generic classes and functions()
-->> STL is use because it is a good idea not to reinvent the wheel
-->> Two employes HP company Alexender and mengle develop STL
---------- In competitive Programming ----------
-->> Limited Time for resizeable array
-->> Limited Time for sort array
-->> Limited Time for search an element

---------- why use STL? ----------
-->> Reuse well tested component
-->> Time saves
---------- components of STL ----------
1. Containers
            (object that store data)(implemented classes reused)
2. Algorithums
            (Set of procedures used for receving a result by menepulating data)(Sorting Algorithum searching Algorithum)

3. iterator
            (an object points to an element in a continer same as pointer but it is an object)
            (connect algorithum with cointainers)(object which points to an element of container)
Example:-
  _________________
  |_1_|_2_|_3_|_4_|...
suppose it is an container now
iterator can point and moved and instructed by algorithum.
