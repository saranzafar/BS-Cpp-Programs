---------- polymorphism ----------
"Ability to take more then one form"
- Poly = Many
- Morphism = Form
- Binding = Which object run which function
Exemple ->> "Function overloading, Operator overloading, Virtual function"

---------- Types of Polymorphism ----------
1. Runtime polymorphism
"In this polymorphism, Program run first then compiler take decision that which function will run according to pointer type.It will achieved By"
    1.1 Virtual Functions
2. Compile Time Polymorphism
"In this polymorphism,In this polymorphism Compiler take decision that which function will run-first. it is also called early binding, Static binding. This polymorphism can be achieved by two ways"
    2.1 Function overloading
    2.2 Operator overloading
