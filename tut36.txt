//********** Inheritance in cpp **********
/*
1. it is part of OOP
2. it increse Reuseability which save time and money
3. it reduce repetation
4. it take attributes of Base class with additional feature
5. if we make  class of name "Employee"(Base class) and 2nd class "Programmer" which
6. take atributes of "Employee" then 2nd class is called derived class
7. we can make more then one derived class & base class
*/
//********** Types of Inheritance in cpp **********
/*
1. Single Inheritance " A derived class with only one base class "
    A --->> B "This arrrow means derives"
    A <<--- B "This arrrow means Is derived from"
2. Multiple Inheritance "A derived class with More Then one base class "
    A --->> C
    B --->> C
3. Hierarchical Inheritance " Several derived class from a single base class "
    C --->> A
    C --->> B
4. Miltilevel Inheritance " Derived a class from already derived class "
    A --->> B --->> C --->> D
    Example    Animal --->> mammal( = animal + more) --->> cow (= mammal + more)
5. Hybrid Inheritance "Is combination of "Multiple inheritance" & "Multilevel inheritance" "
      --->> B
    A         --->> D
      --->> C
