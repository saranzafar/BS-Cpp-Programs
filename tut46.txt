----------- constructors in derived class -----------

1. we can use constructors in derived class.
2. if base class constructor doesn't have any arguments,there is no need to pass argument in constructor of
    derived class.
3. but if there are one or more arguments in base class constructor,derived class need to pass arguments to the base
   class constructor.
4. but both base and derived classes have constructor, base class constructor is executed forst.

----------- constructors in multiple inheritance -----------

1. In Multiple Inheritance, Base classes are constructed in the order in which they appear in the class declaretion.
(chronological order)
2. In Multiple Inheritance, the constructors are executed in order(first then second then so on) of inheritance.

----------- Special Syntax -----------

1. C++ supports in an special syntax for passing argiments to multiple base classes.
2. The constructor of the derived class receives all the arguments at once and then will pass the calls to respective
base classes.
3. The body is called after all the constructors are finished executing.

Derived-constructor(arg1,arg2,arg3,...) : Base1-constructor(arg1,arg2),Base2-constructor(arg3,arg4){
    ...
}Base-constructor(arg1,arg2)

----------- Special Case of virtual base class -----------

1. The constructors for virtual base classes are invoked before an non-virtual base class.
2. If there are multiple virtual base classes, are invoked in order declared.
3. Any non-virtual base class are then constructed before the derived class constructor is executed.
